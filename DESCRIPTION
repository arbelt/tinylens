Description: The 'tinylens' package provides a minimal implementation of
    functional lenses, inspired by the 'lenses' package, which was in turn based
    on the Haskell 'lens' package <https://lens.github.io>. Lenses are
    composable getter/setter pairs that provide a functional approach to manipulating
    deeply nested data structures, e.g., elements within list columns in data
    frames. See the lens wiki for more information on lenses and the history of
    their development: <https://github.com/ekmett/lens/wiki/History-of-Lenses>.
